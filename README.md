# Emotion Based Music Player
> The main objective of this project is to detect emotion and select music to be played based on the emotion which is detected. We will be using Machine Learning for detecting emotions based on the expression of the users. We will deduce the emotion of the user based on their facial expression which we will capture using the webcam.

## Extract Dataset
Before running the code extract the dataset zip file which will be used to predict the emotion.
## Initialize 
``` 
This is our project based on emotion based music system. For this you would require a few modules. They are mentioned below:
1) Open CV
2) Keras
3) Tensorflow
4) Numpy
5) Glob
6) argparser
7) Pandas
```
### Run this project using the command in the terminal 

```
 python EMP.py
```

This way you would be able to run the code and it would take a snap of your face and play the song based on your emotion.
### To update the model
```
 python EMP.py --update
```

This way the system would take a few pictures based on several emotions and would show how well the algorithm is predicting the emotions.
